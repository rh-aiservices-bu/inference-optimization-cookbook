# Inference Optimizations

A reference collection of inference optimization techniques for vLLM and llm-d. Answering the questions:

- What it does?
- What it benefits?
- What are the trade offs?
- How to implement it?

## Technique overview

The below table gives an overview of the optimization techniques, including their major benefit(s), trade off, complexity, and recommendation.

The complexity to implement each optimization is shown, out of:

- 🟢 - Easy
- 🟠 - Medium
- 🔴 - Hard

Recommendations are a binary pass (✅) or fail (❌). Information for why techniques are not recommended will be in their respective folders' `README.md`.

| Optimisation | Benefit | Trade-off | Complexity | Recommended
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [vLLM PyTorch Compile Cache](optimizations/vllm-pytorch-compile-cache/) |  Model Load Time | - | 🟢 | ✅
| [vLLM InstantTensor](optimizations/vllm-instanttensor-loader/) | Model Load Time | - | 🟠 | ❌ |
| [Quantization](optimizations/quantization/) | Memory footprint + Throughput | Model Quality | 🟠 | ✅ |

## Files

- [Optimizations directory](optimizations/) : Where each optimization technique lives. An indiviudal README explaining the technique is in each directory. 
- [Templates directory](./templates/) : Contains templates to help adding optimization techniques in a standardised way.
- [optimization-index.csv](./optimization-index.csv) : A CSV containing every optimization, what it benefits, what it hinders and what it doesn't affect. Essentially a more verbose version of the table [above](./README.md#technique-overview).
